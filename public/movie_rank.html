    <h3>Tron: Legacy</h3>
    <p>
        The special effects and world-building are incredible; it has a banger
        soundtrack by none other than Daft Punk.

    <h3>Gladiator</h3>
    <p>
        Great performance by the actors and a gritty but poignant story.
    </p>

    <h3>Kingdom of Heaven</h3>
    <p>
        Amazing historical film with epic scenes, battles and characters.
